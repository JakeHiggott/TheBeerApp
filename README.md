# TheBeerApp
This is a final project for my Mobile devices course created by me in december 2021. I submitted the initial prototype for the application as my final project and recieved a 100%

I am working on updating it to the point of having a username and password login. 


Current functionality:

- Hits the openBreweryDB api and loads the results into a recycler view. 
- The cells inside the recycler view have an onClickListener where they can be selected and it opens a page for the specific brewery. The way I pass data from activity to activity is a bit redundant and wonky but for the prototype I was under the gun to get it working.
